<p>
    Dispite having every disadvantage, Asta never once gave up on his dream to become the King of all wizards. He did everything he possibly could to become stronger and draw out his own magical power. He never was able to aquire even a drop of magical power. However, his efforts resulted in recieving his own special magicaless grimore and being selected to join the Black Bulls squad. He has also proven time and time again that he is able to hold his own against very skilled magic users. His power continues to grow and perhaps one day he will be able to accomplish his goal of becoming the Wizard King.
