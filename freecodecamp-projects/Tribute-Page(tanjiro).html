    <h3> -What Tanjiro taught us through his story-</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardwork</strong> - If we are willing to devote all of our time and energy into one goal. We will be able to accomplish something great.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience</strong> - We must embrace adversity and failure as lessons. They should never cause us to give up hope.</li>
        <li><strong>Patience</strong> - Worthwhile goals are not accomplished overnight. It will take consistant efforts over a long course of time to reach a worthwhile goal</li>
        <li><strong>Determination</strong> - If we aren't truly devoted to our goal, then it's likely we won't be able to overcome all of the challenges to reach it. We have to make sure the goals we choose to accomplish are goals that align with our values.</li> 
    </ul>
